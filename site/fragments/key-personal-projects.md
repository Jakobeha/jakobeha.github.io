#### Key personal projects:

- **[nominalscript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/nominalscript)** (WIP): Nominal type system over JavaScript, similar to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/). The type system is also formalized in coq
- **[TreeScript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript)**: A language to transform other languages' syntax, similar to [coccinelle](https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/) but more basic and language-agnostic
