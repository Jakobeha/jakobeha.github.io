#### Key personal projects:

- **[nominalscript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/nominalscript)**: Nominal type system over TypeScript, similar to how [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) are structural type systems over JavaScript. A subset of the type system is defined and various properties are proven in Coq (reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, top, bottom)
- **[TreeScript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript)**: A language to transform other languages' syntax, similar to [coccinelle](https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/) but more basic and language-agnostic
