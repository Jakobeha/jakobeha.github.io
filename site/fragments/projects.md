Most of my projects are at <https://github.com/jakobeha>. Very old projects (Descript) are at
<https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/>.

Key projects I've worked on with others:

- **[RIR](https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir)**: A JIT compiler for the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). See the [experience](/experience.html) page for my specific contributions.

Key personal projects:

- **[devolve-ui](https://github.com/Jakobeha/devolve-ui) ([docs](https://jakobeha.github.io/devolve-ui/))**: React-like UI framework for GUI and TUI applications. Utilizes some new-ish concepts like [prompt-based GUI](https://jakobeha.github.io/devolve-ui/prompt-based-gui/)
- **[mini-rx](https://github.com/Jakobeha/mini-rx)**: A tiny "reactive programming" (change propagation) library
- **[TreeScript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript)**: A language to transform other languages' syntax, similar to [Lightweight multi-language syntax transformation with parser parser combinators](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3314589)
- **Descript ([v1 (Haskell)](https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-lang/src/master/) and [v2 (OCaml)](https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-ocaml/src/master/))**: A language designed to transform its own syntax. Descript programs can be applied to other source files, actually modifying them on the file-system
