<h2>PRL@PRG Internship (Ř): January 2020 - May 2020 in Prague</h2>

<p>I was a assistant researcher at the <a href="https://prl-prg.github.io/"><a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;P&#82;&#x4c;&#64;&#x50;&#82;&#x47;">&#x50;&#82;&#x4c;&#64;&#x50;&#82;&#x47;</a></a> lab in Prague, supervised by Jan Vitek. I helped write another paper <strong><a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla20-cd.pdf">Contextual Dispatch for Function Specialization</a></strong> (OOPSLA/SPLASH 2020), and developed a profiler for Ř. After the paper was published, I continued to work on the profiler and added an event logger.</p>

<p>The profiler and event logger measure: number of call sites per function, number of times each function was executed at each call site, total execution time of the function, number of versions of each function (we compile multiple versions for different optimization contexts), time spent in each compilation pass for each version, number of times each function was deoptimized.</p>

<h2>NextDroid Internship</h2>

<p><a href="https://nextdroid.com/">NextDroid</a> provides ground-truth verification for self-driving cars using LIDAR: basically the company puts higher-powered sensors on top of the car's sensors to prove that the car sensors work properly. I worked on the website frontend (TypeScript/JavaScript), backend (node.js), and a camera driver (C++).</p>

<p>For the website, in particular I helped create a camera feed which stays in sync with a video/playback timeline.</p>

<h3>NuPRL (Ř)</h3>

<p>I worked at <a href="http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/">Northeastern's Programming Research Laboratory (NuPRL)</a> on an R JIT compiler called <a href="https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir">Ř (formerly RIR)</a>, with a large team. My specific contributions include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Attempt using Software Transactional Memory to speculatively "force" pure lazy values: if the value triggers a side-effect during evaluation, the side effect will not occur and state will be reverted to before. If the transaction succeeds, we know that the value does not trigger side-effects, which greatly helps analysis.</li>
    <li>Added a configurable assertion that a function won't modify variables outside of its lexical scope. In the R REPL, if a variable gets modified during execution of said function, the interpreter will signal an error and abort the current command.</li>
    <li>Experimented with manually adding extra annotations to functions to improve analysis / optimization, and checking these annotations at runtime</li>
    <li>Bytecode serialization / deserialization, so we don't need to recompile the same function across sessions</li>
    <li>Improved type inference and "type assertions", which validate that the inferred types are actually correct in debug mode</li>
    <li>"Simple ranges": an optimization pass which compiles <code>for (i in a:b) ...</code> into a C-style while loop, avoiding range allocation</li>
    <li>Creating micro-benchmarks for individual components (e.g. while loops), and profiling them</li>
</ul>

<p>We published 2 papers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05118">R Melts Brains</a></strong> (DLS/SPLASH 2019): describes the challenges of implementing a JIT compiler with static analysis in R, mainly because of laziness and first-class environments</li>
    <li><strong><a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla20-cd.pdf">Contextual Dispatch for Function Specialization</a></strong> (OOPSLA/SPLASH 2020): describes a new JIT optimization which creates multiple specialized versions of functions based on their call site context</li>
</ul>

<h2>Northeastern University: September 2017 - January 2020</h2>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a GPA of 3.877 / 4. Notable classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CS4992 Directed Study</strong>: Read papers on abstract interpretation, control flow analysis in Scheme, and STM. Wrote summaries / implemented the algorithms</li>
    <li><strong>CS4992 "Hack Your Own Language"</strong>: Build a DSL in Racket (my group built a JavaDoc-like extension, which parses documentation into Scribble and checks examples)</li>
    <li><strong>CS4910 Verified Compilers</strong>: Build Toy languages / compiler passes in Coq, and prove that passes preserve semantics via simulation relations</li>
    <li><strong>CS4800 Algorithms and Data</strong>: Basic algorithms</li>
    <li><strong>CS4550 Web Development</strong>: Fast overview of client (jQuery, React, Angular, Elm), server (Java + Spring Boot, node.js express, Elixir + Phoenix), and database (MySQL + JPA, PostgreSQL + Ecto, MongoDB) technologies</li>
    <li><strong>CS4500 Software Development</strong>: Develop an application with a team in an industry-like scenario, writing design documents and leading / paneling code walks</li>
    <li><strong>CS4410 Compilers</strong>: Followed <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Compiler-Implementation-Andrew-Appel-ebook/dp/B00D2WQAE8">Modern Compiler Implementation in ML</a></em> and built a Tiger compiler to MIPS: lexer, parser, static semantics, IR generator, assembler, liveness / dataflow analysis, register allocation with coalescing</li>
    <li><strong>CS4200 Networks and Distributed Systems</strong>: High-level overview of how networks and distributed systems work: the ISO-OSI stack, and examples of layer implementations / protocols / distributed systems used in practice (e.g. Ethernet, TCP, Paxos, HTTP)</li>
    <li><strong>CS3650 Systems</strong>: Low-level systems programming (e.g. assembly) and optimization</li>
    <li><strong>CS2800 Logic and Computation</strong>: Basic theorem proving with ACL2s</li>
    <li><strong>CS2500 Fundamentals of Computer Science 1</strong>: Writing simple functional programs in Racket</li>
    <li><strong>ENGW3301 Advanced Writing</strong>: Technical writing to different audiences (e.g. research paper, portfolio)</li>
</ul>

<p>I also attended hackathons and clubs, and presented a poster at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/rise/">RISE</a> (a small University expo) on a side project: <a href="https://github.com/jakobeha/treescript"><strong>TreeScript</strong></a>, a programming language that rewrites syntax of other languages.</p>

<h2>Prior September 2017</h2>

<p>I started programming as a hobby working on side projects. In high school I took AP Computer Science A + AP Computer Science Principles.</p>
